# TRex Loadtest Results
This repo uses GitHub Actions to crunch the committed loadtest
results and deploy them as GitHub Pages.

Details of the setup are in my [Arbitrary workflows with GitHub actions
for fun and pages](https://wejn.org/2021/08/arbitrary-workflows-github-actions/)
post.

Generated results [here](https://wejn.github.io/trex-loadtest-results/).
